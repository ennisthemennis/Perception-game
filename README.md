Perception is a platformer where the world changes around you based on your decision to either kill or avoid enemies. These split second choices have an impact on future gameplay- for example, because you killed one enemy, your reduced jump height and speed may force you to kill another. In some situations, you can’t win unless you kill, and in other, you can’t win if you do. It’s up to you to choose wisely!   Perception was made as part of MIT's month long iOS game development course.   External libraries used were cocos2d, CocosDenshion, Kazmath. Art was obtained from wikimedia commons, and sound was obtained from freesound.org. Pivot stick figure animator, texture packer, and tiled were used in the creation of game art. Ray Wenderlich's Super Koalio platformer tutorial was used as a code template
